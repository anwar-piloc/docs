<p>Each card product is a <b>different card design</b>.
You can have several card products within the same project, each with a unique <code>cardProduct</code> > <code>id</code>.</p>

<p>If you have <b>more than one</b> card product, you can set a <b>default</b> card product.
You can change the default at any time on <b>Dashboard</b> > <b>Settings</b> > <b>Cards</b>.</p>

<p>All <b>new card products</b> undergo a <b>review</b> before you can add cards with that design.
You can also <b>suspend</b> a card product if you don't want it to be available to your users anymore.</p>
