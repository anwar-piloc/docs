# Configure standard cards

Standard designs are used everywhere, such as in-app, in digital Wallets, and when revealing a card's sensitive information, for virtual, physical, and digital cards.

Before creating cards, personalize the standard card design.
You can use Swan's [card design studio](https://swan-io.github.io/card-design-studio/) to get a 3D preview of how your card will look.

:::tip Packaging
You can **customize your packaging** for standard cards. Learn more in the [custom card design guide](./guide-custom.mdx#packaging).

2. Choose black or silver. If you'd like to design a custom card, refer to the [dedicated guide](./guide-custom.mdx).
3. Choose your logo size.
4. Upload your logo, resizing if needed. Don't hesitate to refer to the [guide to create your logo file](./guide-logo.mdx).
5. Click **Save**.

*Note that you can also preview your card in 3D from this page.*

After clicking **Save**, your updates are available immediately in Sandbox.
However, Swan needs to **review changes to Live cards**.
If you didn't upload a new logo, please upload your logo again and click **Save**, which forces the API to trigger a review.
