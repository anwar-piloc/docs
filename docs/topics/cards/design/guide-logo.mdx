# Configure your logo

For both standard and custom card designs, you'll add your logo to the card.

Please follow these guidelines to when creating your SVG file, both so your logo looks great on your card and so Swan can validate the file.


1. The SVG file can be a maximum of **100 kilobytes** (KB).
1. Colors must be **monochrome**:
    - Black cards: white monochrome
    - Silver cards: black monochrome
    - If you'd prefer other color options, consider designing a custom card.
1. Don't use any **opacity** settings. Don't apply the fill-opacity attribute.
1. Don't use any **non-vectorial text**, meaning no text tag.
1. Don't use layering, meaning there should be **no overlaid elements**.
1. The **logo edges** must fit inside the container, or viewbox attribute.


## Troubleshooting

Here are some tips to make sure your logo meets requirements.

| Problem | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Logo appearing too small | If your logo is appearing **smaller than expected**, check that your logo fits perfectly in the SVG viewbox attribute. Any padding between your logo and the viewbox edges will appear on your card. |
| Empty rectangle instead of logo | If you see an **empty rectangle** (black or white) instead of your uploaded logo, there might be an issue with your SVG file. Check that there are no overlaid elements in your file. If there are overlaid elements, remove them and upload the new file. |
| Logo isn't the correct color | If your logo is showing up as black on a black card, or white on a silver card, there might be an issue with your SVG file. Make sure you're not using CSS to apply your color, which is only compatible with browser renderers.  |
