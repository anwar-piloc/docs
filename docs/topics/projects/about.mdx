# Projects overview

Using Swan means using projects.
Partners can have anywhere from one project to a large number of projects depending on the use case.

Users can belong to as many projects as needed.
They always use the same identifier (their phone number) to sign in.

## Project owner

Projects are owned by the **legal person** who opens a **project's first Live account** when activating a Swan project.

Additionally, the project owner's **legal representative**, or legal rep, can perform specific actions, for example implementing security measures such as server consent or viewing their own card numbers with the API.

In Sandbox, you can use the mutation `promoteAccountHolderToProjectOwner` to promote any account holder in order to test project owner behavior.

## Project ID

Each project has a unique Project ID (`projectId`).
On the Dashboard, click-to-copy your Project ID from any page.

## Project access tokens

define project access tokens

Project access tokens:

1. Allow you to **act on your own behalf** rather than on behalf of a user.
1. Allow you to **act as a user within your project**, sometimes referred to as [impersonation](https://docs.swan.io/api/authentication/project-access-token#act-as-a-user-with-a-project-access-token).
1. Must use the **client credentials** OAuth2 flow (also referred to as *grant type*), intended for server-to-server authentication.

Learn more about project access tokens, including how to [retrieve and use them](https://docs.swan.io/api/authentication/project-access-token), in the [authentication](https://docs.swan.io/api/authentication) section.

## Sandbox and Live projects

Projects always start as Sandbox-only.
Projects can remain Sandbox-only if you're goal for the project is to test various implementations.

After a project passes to the status `LimitedLiveAccess`, the project owner can begin testing the Live implementation.
From there, more and more Live access is granted (assuming the project passes reviews).

After a project is Live, you can switch between Sandbox and Live. Use Sandbox to test new features before releasing them to your Live users.

:::caution Can't move between projects
You can't migrate work between projects.
If you have a Live project and you'd like to test an implementation in Sandbox before launching, use that Live project's Sandbox mode.
