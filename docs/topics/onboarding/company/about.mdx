## Company onboarding form

The company onboarding form begins by gathering preliminary details about the company.
Then, Swan collects the following information:

1. User's **email address**.
1. Legal information about the organization, including the **company name**, **registration number** (optional), **VAT number** (optional), and **address**, as well as details about the organization's **activity** and **expected monthly volume**.
1. Information about the company's **ultimate beneficial owners** (UBO).
This step only applies if the user selected **company**, **association** (specifically home owner association), or **other** when submitting their preliminary details.
1. **Required documents** to verify your organization.
    * During onboarding, Swan completes an identity analysis (Know Your Business, or KYB).
    * For the lifetime of the account, Swan monitors for fraud.
1. **Consent** to open the account (consent process requires a mobile device).

:::caution ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª  Germany
For German company accounts, Swan also collects the following during steps 1-3:

1. Legal representative's **country of residence** and **residence address**.
1. Company tax number *(Umsatzsteuer-Identifikationsnummer)*.
1. UBO's **country of residence**, **residence address**, and, if country of residence is `DEU`, UBO's **tax identification number** *(Steuer-Identifikationsnummer)*.

## Identify verification recommendations

Swan must verify the identity of every company.
Swan supports multiple types of identity verification, called `identificationLevels` in the API.

For company onboarding, the following levels are recommended based on the account country.
Please refer to the [section on identity verification](https://docs.swan.io/concept/user#identification-level) for more information on identification levels.

| Account country | Recommended level for companies | Other supported levels |
|---|---|---|
| :fr: France<br/>*includes registered self-employed* | âœ“ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| :de: Germany | âœ“ **Expert** | QES |
| :flag-nl: Netherlands | âœ“ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |
| :es: Spain | âœ“ **Expert** | QES<br/>PVID |

## Country requirements for company accounts

import CountryReqs from '../partials/_country-reqs.mdx';

<CountryReqs thisAccountType="company" thatAccountType="individual" />

For company accounts, use the `onboardCompanyAccountHolder` mutation to collect the following information according to your desired account country.

Note that this section is broken up into company and account holder information, information about the UBO, and information about the legal representative.

All have required fields.
