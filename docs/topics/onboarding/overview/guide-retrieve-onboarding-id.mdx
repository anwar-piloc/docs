# Retrieve an onboarding ID

There are two methods you can use to retrieve an onboarding ID.

1. **Run an API query** to get the ID (you can also use this query to retrieve other information).
1. Locate onboarding IDs on your **Dashboard**.

:::tip Prerequisites
To retrieve an onboarding ID, you must have an existing onboarding, either [individual](../individual/guide-create-onboarding.mdx) or [company](../company/guide-create-onboarding.mdx).  
The onboarding can have [any status](../about.mdx#onboarding-statuses).
:::

## API guide

Queries are highly customizable.
This guide focuses solely on using the `onboardings` query to retrieve onboarding IDs. 
Learn more about this query in the [monitor onboarding progress](./guide-monitor-onboarding.mdx) guide.

1. In the API Explorer, add the `onboardings` query.
1. Check the boxes for `edges` and `node`.
1. Under `node`, check the boxes for `email` and `id`.
Retrieving the user's `email` with the `id` lets you know the user attached to the onboarding ID.
1. Click **â–¶ Run**.

## Dashboard

All onboarding IDs for your project are on your Dashboard.

Go to **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Onboardings**.
The only ID included on this list is the `onboardingId`.
