# Retrieve a transaction ID

There are two methods you can use to retrieve a transaction ID.

1. Locate transaction IDs on your **Dashboard**.
1. **Run an API query** to get the ID.

:::caution 
This documentation typically explains using the API first.
However, it's easier to find a precise transaction ID on the Dashboard.
:::

## Dashboard

All transaction IDs for your project are on your Dashboard.

1. On your Dashboard, go to **Data** > **Transactions**.
1. Find the transaction you need.
1. Scroll horizontally to locate the transaction ID, then click to copy.

## API guide

Queries are highly customizable.
This guide focuses solely on using the `transactions` query to retrieve transaction IDs. 
Learn more about this query in the guide to [get transaction information](./guide-get-transaction-info.mdx).

1. In the API Explorer, add the `transactions` query.
1. Check the boxes for `edges` and `node`.
1. Under `node`, check the boxes for `id`, `createdAt`, and `label`.
    * `label` often contains a name, which might be helpful.
    * `createdAt` could help you identity the payment ID you're searching for if you know when the payment was initiated.
    * Additionally, you might choose to retrieve only the `first` 10 IDs on the list, use [pagination](https://docs.swan.io/api/pagination) to filter further, or add a `totalCount`.
1. Click **â–¶ Run**.
