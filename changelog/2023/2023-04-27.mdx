### Improvements

⚡ Instant SEPA Credit Transfer fallback can be tested using the Testing API.
Initiate an outgoing Instant SEPA Credit Transfer, then reject it using `simulateOutgoingSepaCreditTransferRejection` mutation.
Use `reasonCode`: `BeneficiaryBankNotReachable`.

🫢 Upcoming outgoing Instant SEPA Credit Transfer can be canceled using the `cancelTransaction` mutation.

✍️ The `externalReference` field in `initiateCreditTransfers` is now working for outgoing Instant SEPA Credit Transfer.

🆔 We added the `accountId` field to `Invoice`. Use it to find the account associated to an `AccountInvoice.Generated` webhook event.

### Bug fix

📄 Fee amount are displayed in the `.csv` account statement

### Upcoming breaking changes

👮‍♀️ To avoid undesired behaviors with our API, we are changing the Tax Identification Number (TIN) accepted format in all the `taxIdentificationNumber` inputs from 1-11 characters to 7-11 characters in **4 weeks**.

💥 `isInstant` field for `initiateCreditTransfer` is depreciated and will be removed in 6 months.
Please use `mode` field instead to initiate an Instant SEPA Credit Transfer.
