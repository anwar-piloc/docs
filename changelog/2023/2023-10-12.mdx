### Improvements

⚡ Use the new `mode` field in the `scheduleStandingOrder` mutation to send standing orders as SEPA Instant Credit Transfers.
You can fallback to a regular SEPA Credit Transfer if the instant transfer is rejected.

✏️ You can name your Internal Direct Debit mandates with the `addInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate` mutation name field.
See an example

📬 The field `merchantPostalCode` has been added to the `card` query.

🧪 The `simulateOutgoingCardAuthorizationRelease` testing API mutation received three new values: `Expired`, `MerchantReleased`, and `ManuallyReleased`.
If no value is selected, `Expired` is assigned by default.

📄 You can now query supporting document collections by ID.

### Upcoming breaking changes

🚨 Reminder: The `isInstant` field for `initiateCreditTransfers` will be removed in **4 weeks**.
Please use `mode` instead to initiate a SEPA Instant Credit Transfer.
By using `mode=InstantWithFallback`, your SEPA Instant Credit Transfers will "fallback" to a regular SEPA Credit Transfer if instant isn't available.
