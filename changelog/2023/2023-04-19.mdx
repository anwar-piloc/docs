<h4>New features</h4>

↪️ Direct debit a Swan account within the same project.
It's our first step for our new feature, [Accept Payments](/topics/merchants/idd).
Please contact us if you're interested in beta testing!

<h4>Improvements</h4>

💳 You can print one line of custom text, such as a company name, on your physical cards.
To do so, you'll need to design a custom card with your Technical Account Manager and include this additional line.
Contact us if you're interested in [designing a custom card](/topics/cards/design/guide-custom), or [adapting an existing design](/topics/cards/physical/guide-print#print-additional-line).

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 To avoid undesired behaviors with our API, we changed the accepted date format for two fields in the Onboarding API:

- `IndividualUltimateBeneficialOwnerInput.birthDate` must be a date `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `IndividualUltimateBeneficialOwner.birthDate` format change from `dateTime` to `date`
