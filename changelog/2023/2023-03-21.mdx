#### New features

ðŸŽ¨ The onboarding and transfer pages have a fresh, new design.
And guess what?
We'll be ready to share our code and design system with you in the coming weeks.

ðŸ“ˆ We added Capital Deposits to the **Dashboard** > **Data** section, which was the first step to removing the current Dashboard.
Next, you'll be able to upload documents and simulate everything with the [Event Simulator](/developers/tools/event-simulator).
