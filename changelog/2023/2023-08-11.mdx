### New features

🤩 We redesigned the Data tab on the Dashboard to be more customer centric.
View a list of unique users connected to your project with a 360 view of their accounts and cards.
These improvements should help your operations and customer support teams.

### Improvements

💸 We redesigned the Web Banking transfer page following your feedback.
It's ready to welcome the upcoming International Credit Transfer feature.

🪶 We added two new fields at the transaction level: `reservedAmount` and `reservedAmountReleasedAt`.
Keep an eye on these fields to improve the user experience with account funding and accepting payments, and soon in Web Banking and Dashboard.

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ The `scheme` and `merchantProfileId` inputs are deprecated and will be removed from the `addInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate` API mutation in **6 weeks**.
These inputs were redundant with the `paymentMethodId` input.

⚠️ In the `addInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate` mutation's `AddInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandateSuccessPayload`, the `InternalDirectDebitPaymentMandateId` field will no longer be returned starting **12 weeks** from now.
Please use the `id` available in the `paymentMandate` object instead.
