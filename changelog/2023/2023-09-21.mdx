<h4>New features</h4>

🇳🇱 Dutch IBANs starting with NL are live!
You can test Dutch IBANs with the API or on your **Dashboard** > **Settings** > **Onboarding**.

💡 For each country, Swan must comply with different requirements depending on local laws.
Learn more about requirements for [individual](/topics/onboarding/individual/#country-reqs) and [company](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs) accounts in the Netherlands.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

ℹ️ We added a `reason` to the `ReleasedTransactionStatusInfo` query.
You can now see why a card authorization was released.
Possible values: `Captured`, `Expired`, `AdviceReceived`, `MerchantReleased`, `ManuallyReleased`, and `Other`.

📅 You can now schedule an Internal Direct Debit transaction.
In the `initiateMerchantPaymentCollection` mutation, use the `requestedExecutionAt` field.

❌ The `cancelTransaction` mutation now supports canceling incoming Internal Direct Debit transactions with the status `Upcoming`.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 There are two key changes to the `addInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate` mutation: (1) We removed the `scheme` and `merchantProfileId` fields.
Use `paymentMethodId` instead. (2) The `InternalDirectDebitPaymentMandateId` is no longer returned in the success payload.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ The `isInstant` field for `initiateCreditTransfers` is deprecated and will be removed in **7 weeks**.
Please use `mode` instead to initiate a SEPA Instant Credit Transfer.
By using `mode=InstantWithFallback`, your SEPA Instant Credit Transfers will "fallback" to a regular SEPA Credit Transfer if instant isn't available.

🔍 In the `users` query, search moved to the filters category and requires at least 3 characters.
The old search will be deprecated in **4 weeks**.
