<h4>New features</h4>

🇫🇮 Our end-user interfaces are now available in Finnish.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🤳🏾 To improve the user experience for some payment control use cases, the card spending limits are no longer displayed on the consent screen for the mutations `addCardsWithGroupDelivery`, `addCards`, and `updateCard` (exception: single-use virtual cards).

⚡ Instant transfers are activated by default when initiating SEPA Credit Transfers with Swan's Web Banking interface.
They fallback to regular transfers when instant isn't available.

🚓 To fight efficiently against money laundering, we implemented a new card ATM withdrawal spending limit.
These limits are enforced at the account holder level and can only be modified by Swan.
Review the limits

💼 We added the object `relatedCapitalDepositCase` to the shareholder query in order to provide details about the capital deposit case for any shareholder.

🪝 We added a new webhook, `CapitalDepositDocument.Created`, for when a new a document for a case or a shareholder is created.

‼️ Reminder: the date for `addSepaDirectDebitPaymentMandate` must match the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. Otherwise, we'll return a `ValidationRejection`.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ On February 5th, we're doing a database migration of our webhooks.
Only logs from January 1st on will be migrated, meaning all data from 2023 and before will be lost.
From February 5th on, webhook history will only be kept for 100 days.
This change won't impact the subscriptions.
