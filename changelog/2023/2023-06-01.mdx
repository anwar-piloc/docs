<h4>Improvements</h4>

💲 When a transaction is processed in a currency other than euros €, this currency with the converted amount is now displayed on your Dashboard.

🔎 On the Dashboard Accounts page, we added a "fees" option to the payment product filter.

⚡ When an instant transfer is requested but can't be processed for any reason, we automatically execute a regular transfer instead.
In the transaction history, users will see the method "transfer" instead of "instant transfer", and there will be an alert in the transaction details.
This is only for Swan Web Banking.

⏲️ The Time-To-Live (TTL, auto-disconnection) from both our Dashboard and Web Banking platforms have been reduced.

- Dashboard: reduced to 72 hours; the session will refresh every time an API call is sent.
- Web Banking: reduced to 5 minutes; the session token will refresh as long as the Web Banking page stays open.

📱 We improved mobile navigation for Web Banking for a smoother user experience.
