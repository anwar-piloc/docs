#### New features

🇪🇸 Instant SEPA Credit Transfers for Spanish account are live.
Learn more about requirements for [individual](/topics/onboarding/individual/#country-reqs) and [company](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs) Spanish accounts.

🦢 Swan's design system, [Swan Lake](https://zeroheight.com/6708370bc/p/56dc72-lake), is public!
A natural complement to Swan's open source frontend, Lake gives you a head start with a collection of building blocks for an accessible banking UX/UI.

#### Improvements

🛒 Manage your merchant profiles from the **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Accounts** page.

📃 Generate a PDF version of SEPA Direct Debit payment mandates.
Merchant customers might need to send this PDF to their banks.

📄 Generate custom account statements with your designated 3-month date range directly from the **Web Banking** > **History** page.

📈 To increase the identity verification conversion rate, when the identification fails, we now include a re-engagement link in the text message sent to the user.

👀 We added an unmasked IBAN field for both the debtor and creditor when querying `SEPACreditTransferTransaction` and `SEPADirectDebitTransaction`.
You can choose how much information to expose when using these queries.

😃 Call the `transaction` query with a user access token; a project access token is no longer required.

#### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ In three weeks, we'll start using new enum values for `FeesType` that have been added to the API.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account.
