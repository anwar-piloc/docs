<h4>New features</h4>
🤳🏻 To improve text message deliverability, receive text messages from AUTHLINK instead
of AUTHMSG when consenting to sensitive operations.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

📱 Consent or log in with a QR code if there's an issue receiving the text message.

😃 Run `consents` and `user` queries with a project access token.

🔄 On your **Dashboard** > **Data** tab, check out the Transactions page to view all transactions for your project.

⚠️ We are starting to use the new enum values for `FeesType` that were added to the API three weeks ago.
