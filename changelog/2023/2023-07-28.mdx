<h4>New features</h4>
🫰🏽 As part of our Accept Payments feature, merchants can add a logo to their merchant
profile using the `addMerchantProfile` mutation. An existing merchant profile can
be updated using the `requestMerchantProfileUpdate` mutation.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🍂 When a SEPA Credit Transfer is initiated using `mode=InstantWithFallback` and the transfer is rejected by the beneficiary bank, a fallback will always be triggered except when the recipient account is unknown, closed, or the account holder is deceased.

⛔ As part of our Accept Payments feature, we deleted a few API mutations and fields that were previously flagged as deprecated.
Please note that the deprecated mutations and fields are no longer accessible or supported in any capacity following this release.

- `InternalDirectDebit` is now divided into two different mutations: `InternalDirectDebitStandard` & `InternalDirectDebitB2B`. As a result, `InternalDirectDebitStandardPaymentMethodInput` & `InternalDirectDebitB2BPaymentMethodInput` are new input names to request such payment methods.
