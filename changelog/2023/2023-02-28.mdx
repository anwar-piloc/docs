<h4>New features</h4>

ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª [IBANs starting with `DE`](/topics/accounts/ibans/#local) are live after 3 successful months in beta.
You can use them via the API or no-code, across all use cases including B2B and B2C!
To test them, use the new German onboarding link.
You'll find it in your Dashboard, on the Settings/Onboarding tab.
The German onboarding flow is a little different, in order to comply with German law.
Learn more about requirements for [individual](/topics/onboarding/individual/#country-reqs) and [company](/topics/onboarding/company/#country-reqs) German accounts.

ðŸªª Verify the identity of individual account holders using a [Qualified Electronic Signature](/topics/users/identifications/#levels-processes).
This new identification level is mandatory for individual German IBANs but can also be used for individual French IBANs in order to avoid the first transfer to finalize their identification process.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

âš¡ Our reachability on Instant SEPA Credit Transfers has been extended to TIPS in addition to EBA-RT1.
We're now connected to most banks for initiating and receiving these transactions.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

ðŸ’¥ We will begin using some changes we already warned you about, and have added them to the Graph.
To avoid breaking changes on your side, please take these into account:

- New transaction types: `SepaInstantCreditTransferInRecall` and `SepaInstantCreditTransferOutRecall`.
- New rejection reason codes for `SepaInstantCreditTransferOut` transactions: `CreditorBankTechnicalErrorOccurred` and `CreditorBankTimeout`.
