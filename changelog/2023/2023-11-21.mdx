### New features

üí∏ Customize banking fees for your end users.

### Improvements

üè¶ Access a PDF with your bank details (RIB in France) through the API, Dashboard, or Web Banking.
This PDF contains all the information required to transfer funds to a Swan account.

‚ö° To accelerate the capital deposit process, we now send the funds to the notary with a SEPA Instant Credit Transfer.

### Breaking changes

üí• The deprecated field `isInstant` for `initiateCreditTransfers` was removed.
Please use `mode` instead to initiate SEPA Instant Credit Transfers.
By using `mode=InstantWithFallback`, your SEPA Instant Credit Transfers will ["fallback" to regular SEPA Credit Transfers](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/#instant-fallback) if instant isn't available.

### Upcoming breaking changes

‚ö†Ô∏è In **4 weeks**, we're adding new values to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `LegalRepresentativeProofOfIdentity`, `UltimateBeneficialOwnerProofOfIdentity`, `NIFAccreditationCard`, `PresidentDecisionOfAppointment`, `AdministratorDecisionOfAppointment`, and `FinancialStatements`.
We're also deprecating `ProofOfIdentity`.

‚ö†Ô∏è In **4 weeks**, we'll remove the deprecated `users.search` filter.
Please use `users.filters.search` instead, which operates the same but requires at least 3 characters to search.
