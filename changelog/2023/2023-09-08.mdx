<h4>Improvements</h4>
🔄 When providing consent, users can now request a new text message if the original
text message wasn't received.

📃 We added the `account` object in `accountStatement`.
Use it to link an account to its generated account statements.

🔍 The `transactions` query can now be filtered by `transactionId`.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ In **4 weeks**, we're adding the new value `GeneralAssemblyMinutes` to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum.
