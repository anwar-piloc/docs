<h4>Improvements</h4>

ðŸ’³ We've added new fields to Payment Control messages:

- `terminalId`: The payment terminal that was used to initiate the transaction.
- `mechantPostalCode`: The postal code of the merchant that initiated the transaction (this field will start being populated in October 2023, note that not all merchants communicate this information).
- `digitalCardWalletProvider`: The digital token used for the transaction (when applicable), possible values are: `ApplePay`, `GooglePay`, `Merchant`.

ðŸ§ª The `simulateIncomingInternalDirectDebitReturn` mutation allows to simulate a return on an Internal Direct Debit transaction.
