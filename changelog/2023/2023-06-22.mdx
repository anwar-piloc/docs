### New features

ðŸªª Swan takes another step forward to increase the conversion rate to onboard individual French accounts.
PVID (Prestataire Verification d'IdentitÃ© Ã  Distance) is the latest French identity verification process that provides a fast, secure way to onboard end-customers, with a better user experience.
Thanks to PVID, the first transfer or electronic signature is no longer required for EU users opening accounts with French IBANs.

### Improvements

ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º Every word in every language for Web Banking, Onboarding, text messages, and more (almost 7000 words in 6 languages), was reviewed by our new localization team.
We hope your experience in the supported language of your choice improves significantly, and please continue sharing your language-specific feedback with us.

ðŸ“ˆ We improved webhook performance and resiliency thanks to a full refactoring.

### Breaking changes

ðŸ“± We'll no longer send a text message to users when their identity is successfully verified.
Why?
With the `User` webhooks, you can track their progress and notify them however you choose.
