<h4>New features</h4>

👤 Access identity verification details for you, either with the API or on your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Users**.
See their identification history, the identification levels they've validated, and why an identification attempt might have been rejected.
Because of this new feature, we're deprecating `user.identificationStatus`.

🆔 Swan offers a document-sharing feature, providing access to identity verification document metadata as well as the documents themselves.
Please submit a ticket through your Dashboard to learn more about this feature.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

🆔 Depending on your project's configuration, the notification informing account holders that their account is open will now also be triggered in Sandbox.

🪝 Receive webhooks when a capital deposit document is updated.
Using the new `capitalDepositDocument` query, retrieve its new status and, when rejected, the `reasonCode` with reason for the rejection.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

⚠️ In **4 weeks**, we're adding a new value to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `UltimateBeneficialOwnerProofOfAddress`.
