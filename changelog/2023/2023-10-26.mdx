### Improvements

🇩🇪 Get ready for better conversion rates when onboarding German individual accounts.
When verifying their identity, users can submit their identity document and their
qualified electronic signature (QES) at the same time. Previously, users had to wait
until the document was approved before they could sign.

⚙️ Our API Explorer got a total makeover! In addition to a better user experience, it now includes a history of your requests, a custom favorite list, and manages multiple tabs.
