### New features

↪ When using the Accept Payments feature, merchants can get paid by SEPA Direct Debit with both B2B and Core methods.
The feature is only in Sandbox right now; please let us know if you're interested in beta testing!

🔍 There is a new `transactions` query to make searching transactions easier.

### Improvements

📑 During the KYC process, you can upload supporting documents Swan requires from your end customers, and request a review.
Contact us to activate this feature and receive fewer reminder emails from Swan.

✅ With Internal Direct Debit B2B, use the `addReceivedInternalDirectDebitB2bMandate` mutation to receive the debtor's consent when declaring a payment mandate.

📣 Sometimes, the KYC process is delayed because of website outages for European business registries.
Subscribe to the [Swan status page](https://status.swan.io/) to learn about these delays.
There is a new section called _Onboarding - European Business Registries_ where we will post a live incident about who is affected and the overall level of impact.
