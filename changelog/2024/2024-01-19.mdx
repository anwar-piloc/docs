<h3>New features</h3>

🏦 Swan is now available for [Open Banking aggregators](https://www.swan.io/psd2-api).
They can connect to our API to access the account and transactions.
If you are interested in this, contact us!

<h3>Improvements</h3>

📄 Validate a capital deposit case and change the status of capital deposit documents with the Event Simulator or the Testing API.

<h3>Upcoming breaking changes</h3>

⚠️ In 4 weeks, queries using [pagination](/developers/using-api/pagination) will be limited to 100 elements to load per request.

💥 For API consistency, we deprecated the value `Recurring` for `InternalDirectDebitSequence` and `DirectDebitSequence`.
Please use `Recurrent` instead in the mutations `addInternalDirectDebitPaymentMandate` and `addSepaDirectDebitPaymentMandate`.
