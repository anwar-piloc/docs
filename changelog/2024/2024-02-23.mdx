### New features

‚úÖ Before initiating a credit transfer to a Dutch IBAN from another financial institution, you can now check the account holder's name and account status using the [new `beneficiaryVerification` query](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/#beneficiary-verification).

### Improvements

üí≥ Order cards in the language of your account.
When ordering cards for an account member not already bound to a user, the card language will be the account language and not English by default.

### Breaking changes

‚ö†Ô∏è To prevent capital deposit failures caused by validation rejections related to shareholder onboarding, we are including the same validation checks as those used for onboarding, and we now answer with a `ValidationRejection`.
This provides more specific and restrictive rejection criteria.
