### New features

🇪🇸 Swan's new Physical Card Issuing Hub in Spain is now live.
Physical card shipment to Spanish end-customers now takes less time!
Please contact your account manager if you're interested.

### Improvements

📄 We've added `accountHolder` and `onboarding` in the `supportingDocumentCollection` query to allow you to stop collecting documents via e-mail.
It's more integrated and efficient, making follow-up easier.
You also get better visibility on document collection throughout the onboarding process (status, content …).

### Breaking changes

⚠️ We've added new values to the `SupportingDocumentPurpose` enum: `LegalRepresentativeProofOfIdentity`, `UltimateBeneficialOwnerProofOfIdentity`, `NIFAccreditationCard`, `PresidentDecisionOfAppointment`, `AdministratorDecisionOfAppointment`, and `FinancialStatements`.
We're also deprecating `ProofOfIdentity`.
