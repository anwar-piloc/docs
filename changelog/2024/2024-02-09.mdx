<h3>New features</h3>

🇳🇱 Dutch accounts can now initiate outgoing [Instant SEPA Credit Transfers](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa).

<h3>Improvements</h3>

📈 Performance for your **Dashboard** > **Developers**> **Webhooks** page is improved and now supports all volume and search types.

💳 We've improved your **Dashboard** > **Data** > **Cards** page with new sorting options.
Sort by creation date and last update.
Also, we added the `addressLine2` in the shipping details.

<h3>Breaking changes</h3>

⚠️ As announced in December 2023, all webhooks created before January 2024 are no longer available on your Dashboard following a technical migration.

<h3>Upcoming breaking changes</h3>

💥 For naming consistency, we deprecated the enum value `Recurring` in `InternalPaymentMandateSequence` and `InternalDirectDebitSequence`. Instead, use the new value `Recurrent`.
The deprecated value will be removed in 4 weeks.

✅ We're preparing for changes to the Capital Deposit API, coming in 2 weeks.
Therefore, the API reference for the `createCapitalDepositCase` mutation has been updated to include regex examples.
We're also implementing the same validation checks used for onboarding to provide more specific and strict rejection criteria.
