### New features

📥 You can now export the [user](/topics/users/overview/guide-export/) and [onboarding](/topics/onboarding/overview/guide-export/) data available on the Dashboard in .csv format, either from your Dashboard or with the API by calling the exportUserData and exportOnboardingData mutations. More data will be available to export soon.

### Improvements

📈 The Insights tab on the Dashboard has been updated to include the Accounts funded step in the Onboarding funnel. You can now access a detailed conversion rate of account holders that have opened and funded their accounts.

📊 We’ve added two new graphs to the transactions data within your Dashboard's Insights tab. We now display the total volume of incoming and outgoing transactions by payment method.

🚌 **Payment Control** now allows you to filter transactions related to transportation expenses. Use the `TransactionTransportType` field, which mirrors the Transit Transaction Type Indicator shared from Mastercard.

### Breaking changes

ℹ️ As announced on [July 19th](/changelog/19-july-2024/), the onboardingUrl parameter of our onboarding object is now set to null when an onboarding is finalized.

### Upcoming breaking changes

⚠️ In the coming weeks, we'll introduce an additional permission to [initiate a credit transfer](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/sepa/guide-initiate-ct/) to an unsaved beneficiary, meaning not previously added as a [trusted beneficiary](/topics/payments/credit-transfers/#beneficiaries-permissions).

- From October 21st, account members must have both `canInitiatePayment` and `canManageBeneficiary` permissions to initiate a credit transfer to an unsaved beneficiary.
- Swan will grant existing account members with `canInitiatePayment` with the `canManageBeneficiary` on October 21st.

Please ensure that new account members, created after October 21st, have both permissions to initiate a credit transfer to an unsaved beneficiary.
