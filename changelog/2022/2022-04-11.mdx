### New features

🎨 Full redesign of our dashboard to improve the Developer Experience.

### Improvements

❌ Your customer service folks can easily cancel upcoming credit transfers, or cancel and suspend cards, thanks to some new buttons.

🗒️ Account statements are listed in the dashboard, or you can generate them yourself.

📆 In the onboarding API, we added creation date and last updated date, and improved some error messages.

### Bug fix

🆔 The `cardId` is now correctly sent within the redirection URL of the `activatePhysicalCard` mutation.

### Breaking changes

🔢 We activated pagination on onboarding.
