#### New features

🇫🇷 Offer [Capital Deposit](/topics/capital-deposits) to your French customers. Enable the registration of new companies directly from your product, by providing an account and proof that the share capital has been wired by shareholders.

📦 Ship a group of cards altogether to the same address using the `addCardsWithGroupDelivery` mutation. It's more cost-effective, and better for the planet!

#### Improvements

🆔 Simulate Sandbox user's identification status from the dashboard

📅 Transactions are better sorted in our web banking thanks to a new transaction.`executionDate` field. For `Upcoming` transactions, it reflects the requested execution date. For all other transactions it reflects the creation date.

💳 The maximum number of cards you can create using the `addCards` mutation has been increased from 200 to 500

🪝 New webhooks are available for creating and updating Received Direct Debit Mandates

📝 SEPA Direct Debit-Out B2B Mandates Amendments can now be registered with Swan using the [`UpdateReceivedSepaDirectDebitB2bMandate` mutation](/topics/payments/direct-debit/guide-update-mandate).

#### Bug fix

📠 We fixed some bugs for the users of old browsers (IndexedDB issues)

#### Breaking changes

🏦 New `PaymentProduct` and `TransactionType` enum values have been added in order to provide you with a greater level of detail and an improved experience. These new enum values that were previously listed as `COMING SOON` are now populated. The enum values marked `COMING SOON` will be populated during the next release. Some other enum values (listed as `SOON TO BE DEPRECATED`) will be deprecated in the next Swan release, therefore please make sure you take these changes into account.

🙅🏼‍♂️ We will start sending the following `RejectedReasonCodes` for card transactions that were created during the last release: `CardNotActivated`, `InvalidPin`, `InvalidPinAttemptsExceeded`

🙅🏾‍♀️ Many new Rejections related to the card and already added during the last release are now populated. They should provide you with a greater level of detail and an improved experience.
