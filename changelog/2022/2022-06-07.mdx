<h4>New features</h4>

📈 Instantly load your customers' accounts with SEPA Direct Debit. This is one of our biggest features of the year! Contact us if you're interested in joining the beta testers group.

🤳🏿 Accept up to 100 consents with just one single Strong Customer Authentication.

📄 When finalizing your customers' onboarding, you can now use the API to consult the list of minimum required supporting document purposes. Using this feature will reduce a lot of back-and-forths. In 90% of account openings, we require documents for just one single purpose. However, if an individual presents a higher risk than expected, we ask for additional documents.

<h4>Improvements</h4>

✅ Clearly see where you are in the activation process, right from the dashboard header. Just click “Activate.”

📃 If you're opening accounts for companies, you can now upload supporting documents using the nocode onboarding interface.

👤 For a better UX, we decided to remove the last page of user registration (Sign in).

🔍 You can now search a first or last name in the account membership list.

🪝 A new webhook `onboarding.updated` is triggered when onboarding is finalized.

🔄 Funding sources are listed in the dashboard.

✖️ A funding source with `Pending` or `Enabled` status can be `Canceled` by any account member with `Can Manage Account Membership` user rights using the `cancelFundingSource` mutation.

👮🏻 The Account Verification status of a SDD B2B funding source is automatically switched to `verified` when the Rolling Reserve amount is released from the reserved balance (if no R-transaction has been received)

💳 A new reason code has been added for refused card transactions: `MerchantShouldResubmitAuthorization`

💸 Card `spending` was not being released when the authorization amount was released.

<h4>Bug fix</h4>

💳 Some card options were recently desynchronized at our card processor. We've fixed this.

<h4>Breaking changes</h4>

💥 Account funding is in beta, so there are sometimes breaking changes: `accountHolder.fundingLimit` and `accountHolder.instantFundingLimit` is deprecated and moved to a new resource `accountHolder.fundingLimitSettings` respectively in `accountHolder.fundingLimitSettings.fundingLimit` and `accountHolder.fundingLimitSettings.instantFundingLimit`.

<h4>Upcoming breaking changes</h4>

📃 Next release, in early July, we will rename the Supporting Document status `ReviewPending` to `PendingReview`.
