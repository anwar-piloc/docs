### New features

💰 Add an Account detail tab in the web banking menu (level 1) lets you access the main IBAN, manage virtual IBANs, and update account settings.

👩🏼‍💻 The web banking has a new profile page that allows users to manage their languages, reminds them to verify their identity, and provides access to FAQ and support.

### Improvements

⛔ UBO doesn't mean anything to French "syndicat de copropriété" and "associations" so we removed them from the nocode onboarding.

⚖️ A "legal representative" tile was added to the dashboard for company account holders.

🔗 The authentication SMS was changed from swan.io to authmsg.co, for better whitelabeling.

🔐 Most of the time, we won't display the Captcha anymore — the one displayed when the user enters their phone number. This doesn't take away from the level of security.

🌬️ The Refund API mutation can now be used on `SepaInstantCreditTransferIn` transactions

### Breaking changes

📅 The deprecated field `executionDate` used as an input for the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation was permanently removed and replaced by `requestedExecutionAt`.

🈲 For regulatory reasons, we will no longer accept special characters in the `SepaBeneficiary` `name` input fields for the `initiateCreditTransfers` mutation. Chinese and Cyrillic characters will no longer be allowed.
