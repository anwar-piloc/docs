<h4>Improvements</h4>

ðŸš” We added a security captcha when there is some doubt concerning the phone number entered, in order to increase the level of security. This should impact only 0.5% of users.

ðŸ’³ To avoid strong authentication for the end customer each time the [card number is revealed](/topics/cards/virtual/guide-view-info), we now allow calling the same `consentUrl` for 5 minutes after consenting. For this, we advise you to store the `consentId` on your side and to run a consent query each time before reusing the `consentUrl` to check that the consent status is `Accepted` and the `updatedAt` is less than 5min.
